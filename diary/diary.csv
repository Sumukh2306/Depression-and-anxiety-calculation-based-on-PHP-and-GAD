Sumukha DN,2023-04-24,Dear DiaryToday was a complete disaster. Nothing went as planned and I feel utterly defeated. The weight of failure hangs heavy on my shoulders suffocating any glimmer of hope. I can't shake this overwhelming sense of despair and it feels like the world is conspiring against me.
